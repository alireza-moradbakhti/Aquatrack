ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Architecture : 

This project serves as a demonstration of modern Android development practices and showcases a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

Architecture:

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): A clean and scalable architectural pattern.

Clean Architecture Principles: Separation of concerns between UI, Domain, and Data layers.

Repository Pattern: Abstracting the data source from the rest of the app.

Tech Stack:

UI: Jetpack Compose - Android's modern, declarative UI toolkit.

Dependency Injection: Hilt - For managing dependencies and simplifying the app's structure.

Database: Room - A persistence library for local SQLite database storage.

Asynchronous Programming: Kotlin Coroutines & Flow - For managing background threads and handling data streams reactively.

Animation: Lottie for Compose - For rendering beautiful, high-quality animations.

Build Management: Gradle with Version Catalog - For centralized and scalable dependency management.

Code Generation: KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) - The modern, high-performance replacement for KAPT.
